<h2>Spotify Project</h2>

<p>Hello! This is a project for a copy of Spotify made for studies.</p>

<p>Currently, it is my biggest project and I am looking to apply much of my knowledge involving my area of ​​expertise, web development.</p>
<p>In this project, i am using tools such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>HTML, CSS and Javascript;</li>
  <li>Sass to have more refined organization and control over page styling;</li>
  <li>React for navigation between pages and form validation;</li>
  <li>Gulp for compilation of .scss files into .css files;</li>
  <li>Python for the back-end working together with the Flask framework, to handle requests, 
    also with navigation between simultaneous pages with React, and everything involving music player, music records playlists</li>
  <li>Google Firebase for the user registration and connection structure</li>
</ul>
